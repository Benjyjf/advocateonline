<h1 class="header">FALL 2015 COMP</h1>
<p class="text">
Between its seven boards--Art, Business, Design, Features, Fiction, Poetry, Technology--The Advocate provides a home for writers, artists, critics, designers, web designers, dealmakers, and all others with an interest in the arts and letters. Every semester, The Advocate selects new members through a “Comp” process open to all Harvard undergraduates.<br><br>

This semester, introductory comp meetings will take place at the Advocate building on the following dates:
<br><b>Monday, September 7th at 8pm</b> 
<br><b>Thursday, September 10th at 8pm </b>

<br><br>
 Compers are evaluated exclusively on their ability to discuss, write about, create, design, sell, or code art. Though our comp is selective, our hope is that all participants will find it an enriching and rewarding experience. Please direct specific questions about the comp to the <a href="http://theharvardadvocate.com/about">editor of the board</a> that you are interested in comping. Updates to the intro comp meeting will be posted on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1470348573293133/">Facebook event page</a>.
